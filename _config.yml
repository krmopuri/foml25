course_description: "Deep Learning has lately become the driving force behind numerous high-performing AI/ML products deployed in
real world across diverse disciplines. Tech giants such as Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, etc. have strongly been employing 
the Deep Learning workforce in the past few years for developing various applications in Computer Vision, Natural Processing, etc.
Also, various organizations, such as OpenAI, DeepMind, etc., that intend to work towards developing safe and responsible Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) conduct research in Deep Learning.
Hence, it has recently become one of the most sought-after courses. In this course, we will discuss (with a focus on the implementation) the various
building blocks required to realize the Deep Learning solutions all the way from a simple neuron model to Generative AI."

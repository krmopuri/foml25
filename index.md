## (AI2000/AI5000) Foundations of Machine Learning Course Contents

Welcome to the Foundations on Machine Learning (FoML) course! In this course, you will explore the foundational concepts and techniques behind machine learning, a key driver of modern artificial intelligence. We will discuss key concepts in supervised and unsupervised learning, probability theory, and neural networks, with a strong emphasis on the probabilistic and Bayesian approaches prevalent in modern machine learning. The course integrates mathematical concpets with hands-on programming experience, covering topics like linear models, kernel methods, and clustering techniques. By the end of the semester, students will be equipped with a deep understanding of machine learning principles and practical skills for data analysis and modeling.
